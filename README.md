# Online Payment Fraud Detection

Our goal is to identify fraud in online payments. To do this, we will train models to classify payments as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. We will test several different classifiers and conclude based on the most efficient one among them.

We will use the following dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rupakroy/online-payments-fraud-detection-dataset, which contains information on online payment fraud, allowing us to identify which types of transactions lead to fraud.

The data contains historical information on fraudulent transactions, which can be used to generate the classifiers.

The project details can be found in the ipynb file.
